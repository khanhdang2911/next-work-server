# Nextwork System â€“ Backend

## Introduction

This is the Backend service of the **Nextwork Internal Messaging System**, serving as the backbone of the application. It handles all business logic, data management, and provides APIs for the Frontend. Built with Node.js and Express, the Backend system ensures high performance, security, and scalability to meet the internal communication needs of enterprises.

The Backend also integrates Socket.IO to provide real-time messaging capabilities, ensuring instant information delivery between users.

### **User Authentication**

* Traditional account registration and login
* Email verification and password recovery
* Support for Google (OAuth) and Auth0 login
* Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and security
* Supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security

### **User Management**

* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for user information
* Management of user roles and permissions (member, admin)
* APIs for System Admin to lock/unlock user accounts system-wide

### **Workspace Management**

* CRUD APIs for creating, editing, and deleting workspaces
* Management of members within a workspace (add, remove, assign roles)
* APIs for System Admin to manage workspaces system-wide

### **Channel Management**

* CRUD APIs for creating, editing, and deleting chat channels
* Management of members within a channel (add, remove, assign roles)

### **Messaging System**

* APIs for sending and receiving text messages, images, and file attachments
* Supports personal messages (Direct Message) and group messages (Channel Message)
* APIs allowing message editing and deletion
* APIs for reacting to messages
* Stores chat history and supports search functionality

### **Real-time Communication**

* Uses Socket.IO for instant message delivery, notifications, and status updates

### **Attachment Management**

* APIs for uploading and managing file attachments (images, documents)

### **Invitation Management**

* APIs for creating and managing invitations to join workspaces/channels via email

### **Chatbot Interaction**

* APIs supporting interaction with an AI Assistant powered by Azure OpenAI

### **Data Security**

* Hashes and encrypts user passwords before storing them in the database
* Uses HTTPS to encrypt all data during transmission between client and server

   # MongoDB Configuration
   MONGO_DB_URL = "mongodb+srv://xxx:xxx@xxx" # Your MongoDB connection string
   MONGO_DB_NAME = "xxx"                      # Your MongoDB database name
   MONGO_DB_USER = "xxx"                      # Your MongoDB username
   MONGO_DB_PASSWORD = "xxx"                  # Your MongoDB password

   # JWT & OTP Configuration
   SECRET_PASSWORD = "xxx"                 # Secret key for password hashing
   EXPIRE_IN = "xh"                        # JWT expiration time (e.g., "1h", "7d")
   JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SIZE = x             # Size of JWT refresh token in characters
   OTP_TOKEN_SIZE = x                      # Size of OTP token
   OTP_SALT_ROUNDS = x                    # Salt rounds for OTP hashing

   # Auth0 Configuration
   AUTH0_AUDIENCE = "xxx"                  # Auth0 Audience
   AUTH0_ISSUER = "xxx"                   # Auth0 Issuer URL

   # Email Service Configuration
   MAIL_USER = "xxx"                       # Email sender username

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The server will run on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 8099).

### Running with Docker

You can also run the application using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t nextwork-backend .
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8099:8099 --env-file .env nextwork-backend
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8099`.


## API Endpoints

## Deployment

The Backend is deployed on **Azure Virtual Machines** and managed using **Docker**. An **Nginx Load Balancer** is used to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the API Service, ensuring high availability and performance. The deployment process is automated via **GitHub Actions**.

### Deployment Architecture

1. **Load Balancing**: Nginx distributes traffic across multiple backend instances
2. **Containerization**: Docker ensures consistent deployment environments
3. **Auto Scaling**: Multiple VM instances handle varying loads
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of system performance and health
